# Configuring o Babel

Firstly, through the package manager JavaScript - Yarn we will open a session to create a JSON package that will configure and manage dependencies of the application.

The commando do create a JASON Package in yarn pm is:

    yarn init

After that, you will see in terminal, questions, you can press enter for all, up until show the message
of "Done!".

The correct way to do the steps above is, before codding, you create a folder to save the JSON package, where will be saved the package.json file.

Now, after the code you will see in the folder the package.json file, like that:

You can see, the package.json file is in the "course-es6" folder, this happens because I wrote the code in a selected repository at prompt.

# Babel installing (dependency yarn)

yarn dev

"dev" is the name of the script that I was created.

In the folder, you can see, bundle.js was created and this is the script what you must put in HTML body:

    <script src="bundle.js"></script>-

Now, finally, your code is running in whatever browser and in your respective ECMAScript version.
